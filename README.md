# Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

I was motivated to build a Prework Study Guide webpage to enable me to learn more HTML, CSS and JavaScript and gain experience in using GitHub. I built this webpage to make it easier to store and retrieve study notes from my learning. The webpage provides a central point to access all of my notes. I learnt how to use HTML to structure the page, CSS to style the page and JavaScript to add functionality to the page. I also learnt how to use GitHub for version control.

## Usage

This webpage includes notes on four topics: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git. When you open the console using DevTools (by rightclicking and selecting 'inspect console') you can see the JavaScript running. The JavaScript lists the topics we've learned from the prework and helps us to choose which topic to study first.
